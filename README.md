# FindPill (필통)
A React Native mobile application designed to assist users in identifying individual pills just by taking a picture. Initially created with a focus on aiding the visually impaired, the app is coded to ensure full compatibility with screen readers.  
The backend functionality can be found at [FindPill-Backend](https://github.com/doyoungp00/FindPill-Backend.git)  
The machine learning model was trained using Azure Custom Vision.

## Functions
### 1. Identify pills via phone camera
Snap a close up picture of a pill to instantly see results on the fly.
### 2. Identify pills via dedicated device
Use a dedicated device to go beyond image recognition. The app can support using a dedicated device for measuring a pill's physical properties, enhancing accuracy and expanding its usability.
### 3. Search and read pill descriptions and warnings
A separate text search menu for pills you already know the name of.

## How to Build
To build and run locally:

1. Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your machine if not already installed.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/doyoungp00/FindPill.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd findpill
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
5. Start the Expo development server:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
6. Open the Expo Go app on your mobile device and scan the QR code generated by the development server to launch the app.
7. The app uses an env file to store the backend server address. The env file should contain the keys `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND`, each for uploading images to Firebase, and using the API for the search functionality.
